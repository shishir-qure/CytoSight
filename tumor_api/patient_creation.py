Each patient should have 6-15 encounters representing their current position in the cancer continuum. Include diverse presentation patterns: screening-detected cases, symptom-driven presentations (persistent cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, bone pain from metastases), cases with comorbid conditions affecting treatment decisions, different staging scenarios (Stage I operable, Stage III locally advanced, Stage IV metastatic), various treatment responses (complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease), treatment complications (neutropenia, neuropathy, pneumonitis, secondary infections), and realistic disease trajectories. Each encounter must include appropriate diagnostic tests, pathology reports when relevant, detailed physician notes reflecting current clinical challenges, and care plans addressing immediate needs. Ensure realistic timelines - show actual cancer progression patterns, treatment response curves, and complications as they naturally occur. Include patients with poor prognosis, treatment failures, quality of life issues, and difficult clinical decisions. Make demographics diverse (age 40-85, various smoking histories, different socioeconomic backgrounds affecting care access).
